## About the Project
Digital libraries have transformed how we access and explore vast collections of books, making it easy to search, sort, and find exactly what we need with just a few keystrokes. The basic search engine is at the heart of this and many other modern conveniences.

In this lab, you will create a [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) search engine. Your application will allow users to search for a file by name, read and populate objects with data, and sort these objects using algorithms. It will also feature a user-friendly menu, log activities, search data, and serialize objects for storage. By the end, you’ll have hands-on experience with data structures, algorithms, and file I/O in Java while building a functional digital library system.

## Features

The digital library system you’ll develop manages a collection of books, with all book data stored in a single file named “books.txt”. Each line in this file represents a book, including its title, author, and publication year; for example:

- The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925

- To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee, 1960

- 1984, George Orwell, 1949

**Feature 1**: Your search engine program will allow users to search for specific books within this file and view their details. 

**Feature 2**: Users should be able to sort the list of books based on various criteria, such as title, author, or publication date. 

**Feature 3**: To provide a seamless user experience, you’ll create a text-based menu-driven interface that facilitates easy navigation through these options. 

**Feature 4**: Additionally, to ensure that user data and interactions are preserved across sessions, you will implement serialization to save the current state of the library to a file named “library.ser.” 

> This will allow the program to restore the library's state the next time it is started. 

**Feature 5**: User interactions, such as searches and sorts, will also be logged to a file named “user_interactions.log” for auditing and debugging purposes.
